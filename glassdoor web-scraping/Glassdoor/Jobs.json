Likely starting date: January 2020.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nProject background\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nCorrosion of infrastructures, such as bridges and pipelines, causes high costs to society and impairs the safety and the quality of life. This project forms part of a larger research framework, aiming at innovative corrosion mitigation strategies, based on electrochemical methods. We combine methods from corrosion science, environmental sciences, and reactive transport modeling. In particular, we seek to address the challenge of corrosion of steel-based infrastructures surrounded by porous media, such as reinforcing steel in concrete and steel in soil.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nJob description\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nThe aim of this PhD project is to develop a comprehensive numerical model framework that takes into account all relevant processes occurring at the steel surface and in the porous medium when a metal is subjected to electrochemical polarization. The main novelty lies in developing the scientific theory to consider the electrochemical reaction kinetics at the protected metal as a function of the electrolyte chemistry, and to couple this with state-of-the-art reactive multi-species transport modeling in porous media. We will focus on steel corrosion in (sandy) soils and in cementitious materials (mortar, concrete). To obtain the needed input data and to validate the model, this project will be closely linked to an on-going experimental PhD study in the research group, which takes advantage of latest developments in in-situ sensing techniques (pH, O2, Cl&amp;ndash;) and microstructural characterization.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nThe conditions of employment are based on the Swiss Federal Personnel Act and the ETH Personnel Ordinance. The salary rates of PhD students are in agreement with the employment conditions of ETH (covering living expenses).\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nYour profile\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nSuccessful applicants should hold a MSc degree preferably in engineering, physics, mathematics, geophysics or related areas with a strong background in numerical modeling. Ideally, the candidate is already experienced with reactive transport modeling in porous media. Knowledge in corrosion is not required, but the candidate is expected to show a strong interest in this field and to study the theory. Proficiency in written and oral English as well as maturity and self-motivation are necessary.

Likely starting date: January 2020.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nProject background\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nCorrosion of infrastructures, such as bridges and pipelines, causes high costs to society and impairs the safety and the quality of life. This project forms part of a larger research framework, aiming at innovative corrosion mitigation strategies, based on electrochemical methods. We combine methods from corrosion science, environmental sciences, and reactive transport modeling. In particular, we seek to address the challenge of corrosion of steel-based infrastructures surrounded by porous media, such as reinforcing steel in concrete and steel in soil.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nJob description\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nThe aim of this PhD project is to develop a comprehensive numerical model framework that takes into account all relevant processes occurring at the steel surface and in the porous medium when a metal is subjected to electrochemical polarization. The main novelty lies in developing the scientific theory to consider the electrochemical reaction kinetics at the protected metal as a function of the electrolyte chemistry, and to couple this with state-of-the-art reactive multi-species transport modeling in porous media. We will focus on steel corrosion in (sandy) soils and in cementitious materials (mortar, concrete). To obtain the needed input data and to validate the model, this project will be closely linked to an on-going experimental PhD study in the research group, which takes advantage of latest developments in in-situ sensing techniques (pH, O2, Cl&amp;ndash;) and microstructural characterization.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nThe conditions of employment are based on the Swiss Federal Personnel Act and the ETH Personnel Ordinance. The salary rates of PhD students are in agreement with the employment conditions of ETH (covering living expenses).\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nYour profile\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nSuccessful applicants should hold a MSc degree preferably in engineering, physics, mathematics, geophysics or related areas with a strong background in numerical modeling. Ideally, the candidate is already experienced with reactive transport modeling in porous media. Knowledge in corrosion is not required, but the candidate is expected to show a strong interest in this field and to study the theory. Proficiency in written and oral English as well as maturity and self-motivation are necessary.

Likely starting date: January 2020.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nProject background\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nCorrosion of infrastructures, such as bridges and pipelines, causes high costs to society and impairs the safety and the quality of life. This project forms part of a larger research framework, aiming at innovative corrosion mitigation strategies, based on electrochemical methods. We combine methods from corrosion science, environmental sciences, and reactive transport modeling. In particular, we seek to address the challenge of corrosion of steel-based infrastructures surrounded by porous media, such as reinforcing steel in concrete and steel in soil.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nJob description\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nThe aim of this PhD project is to develop a comprehensive numerical model framework that takes into account all relevant processes occurring at the steel surface and in the porous medium when a metal is subjected to electrochemical polarization. The main novelty lies in developing the scientific theory to consider the electrochemical reaction kinetics at the protected metal as a function of the electrolyte chemistry, and to couple this with state-of-the-art reactive multi-species transport modeling in porous media. We will focus on steel corrosion in (sandy) soils and in cementitious materials (mortar, concrete). To obtain the needed input data and to validate the model, this project will be closely linked to an on-going experimental PhD study in the research group, which takes advantage of latest developments in in-situ sensing techniques (pH, O2, Cl&amp;ndash;) and microstructural characterization.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nThe conditions of employment are based on the Swiss Federal Personnel Act and the ETH Personnel Ordinance. The salary rates of PhD students are in agreement with the employment conditions of ETH (covering living expenses).\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nYour profile\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nSuccessful applicants should hold a MSc degree preferably in engineering, physics, mathematics, geophysics or related areas with a strong background in numerical modeling. Ideally, the candidate is already experienced with reactive transport modeling in porous media. Knowledge in corrosion is not required, but the candidate is expected to show a strong interest in this field and to study the theory. Proficiency in written and oral English as well as maturity and self-motivation are necessary.

Likely starting date: January 2020.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nProject background\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nCorrosion of infrastructures, such as bridges and pipelines, causes high costs to society and impairs the safety and the quality of life. This project forms part of a larger research framework, aiming at innovative corrosion mitigation strategies, based on electrochemical methods. We combine methods from corrosion science, environmental sciences, and reactive transport modeling. In particular, we seek to address the challenge of corrosion of steel-based infrastructures surrounded by porous media, such as reinforcing steel in concrete and steel in soil.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nJob description\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nThe aim of this PhD project is to develop a comprehensive numerical model framework that takes into account all relevant processes occurring at the steel surface and in the porous medium when a metal is subjected to electrochemical polarization. The main novelty lies in developing the scientific theory to consider the electrochemical reaction kinetics at the protected metal as a function of the electrolyte chemistry, and to couple this with state-of-the-art reactive multi-species transport modeling in porous media. We will focus on steel corrosion in (sandy) soils and in cementitious materials (mortar, concrete). To obtain the needed input data and to validate the model, this project will be closely linked to an on-going experimental PhD study in the research group, which takes advantage of latest developments in in-situ sensing techniques (pH, O2, Cl&amp;ndash;) and microstructural characterization.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nThe conditions of employment are based on the Swiss Federal Personnel Act and the ETH Personnel Ordinance. The salary rates of PhD students are in agreement with the employment conditions of ETH (covering living expenses).\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nYour profile\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nSuccessful applicants should hold a MSc degree preferably in engineering, physics, mathematics, geophysics or related areas with a strong background in numerical modeling. Ideally, the candidate is already experienced with reactive transport modeling in porous media. Knowledge in corrosion is not required, but the candidate is expected to show a strong interest in this field and to study the theory. Proficiency in written and oral English as well as maturity and self-motivation are necessary.

Likely starting date: January 2020.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nProject background\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nCorrosion of infrastructures, such as bridges and pipelines, causes high costs to society and impairs the safety and the quality of life. This project forms part of a larger research framework, aiming at innovative corrosion mitigation strategies, based on electrochemical methods. We combine methods from corrosion science, environmental sciences, and reactive transport modeling. In particular, we seek to address the challenge of corrosion of steel-based infrastructures surrounded by porous media, such as reinforcing steel in concrete and steel in soil.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nJob description\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nThe aim of this PhD project is to develop a comprehensive numerical model framework that takes into account all relevant processes occurring at the steel surface and in the porous medium when a metal is subjected to electrochemical polarization. The main novelty lies in developing the scientific theory to consider the electrochemical reaction kinetics at the protected metal as a function of the electrolyte chemistry, and to couple this with state-of-the-art reactive multi-species transport modeling in porous media. We will focus on steel corrosion in (sandy) soils and in cementitious materials (mortar, concrete). To obtain the needed input data and to validate the model, this project will be closely linked to an on-going experimental PhD study in the research group, which takes advantage of latest developments in in-situ sensing techniques (pH, O2, Cl&amp;ndash;) and microstructural characterization.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nThe conditions of employment are based on the Swiss Federal Personnel Act and the ETH Personnel Ordinance. The salary rates of PhD students are in agreement with the employment conditions of ETH (covering living expenses).\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nYour profile\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nSuccessful applicants should hold a MSc degree preferably in engineering, physics, mathematics, geophysics or related areas with a strong background in numerical modeling. Ideally, the candidate is already experienced with reactive transport modeling in porous media. Knowledge in corrosion is not required, but the candidate is expected to show a strong interest in this field and to study the theory. Proficiency in written and oral English as well as maturity and self-motivation are necessary.

Likely starting date: January 2020.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nProject background\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nCorrosion of infrastructures, such as bridges and pipelines, causes high costs to society and impairs the safety and the quality of life. This project forms part of a larger research framework, aiming at innovative corrosion mitigation strategies, based on electrochemical methods. We combine methods from corrosion science, environmental sciences, and reactive transport modeling. In particular, we seek to address the challenge of corrosion of steel-based infrastructures surrounded by porous media, such as reinforcing steel in concrete and steel in soil.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nJob description\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nThe aim of this PhD project is to develop a comprehensive numerical model framework that takes into account all relevant processes occurring at the steel surface and in the porous medium when a metal is subjected to electrochemical polarization. The main novelty lies in developing the scientific theory to consider the electrochemical reaction kinetics at the protected metal as a function of the electrolyte chemistry, and to couple this with state-of-the-art reactive multi-species transport modeling in porous media. We will focus on steel corrosion in (sandy) soils and in cementitious materials (mortar, concrete). To obtain the needed input data and to validate the model, this project will be closely linked to an on-going experimental PhD study in the research group, which takes advantage of latest developments in in-situ sensing techniques (pH, O2, Cl&amp;ndash;) and microstructural characterization.\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nThe conditions of employment are based on the Swiss Federal Personnel Act and the ETH Personnel Ordinance. The salary rates of PhD students are in agreement with the employment conditions of ETH (covering living expenses).\\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\nYour profile\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nSuccessful applicants should hold a MSc degree preferably in engineering, physics, mathematics, geophysics or related areas with a strong background in numerical modeling. Ideally, the candidate is already experienced with reactive transport modeling in porous media. Knowledge in corrosion is not required, but the candidate is expected to show a strong interest in this field and to study the theory. Proficiency in written and oral English as well as maturity and self-motivation are necessary.
