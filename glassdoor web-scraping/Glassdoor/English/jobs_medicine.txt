What you can expect  Malaria continues to be an exceptional burden on global public health. While we have seen a worldwide decline in malaria incidence and mortality at the beginning of the 21st century, emerging resistance to antimalarials as well as insecticides pose threats to these trends. Vector control (targeting the mosquito instead of the parasite) through mass drug administration of systemic endectocides is a promising new strategy in malaria prevention.  Pharmacometrics is a discipline that quantifies drugs, disease progression, and clinical trials using mathematical models. Its results directly improve patient care, provide personalized medicine, inform clinical trial design, and aid in drug development.

Functional neurostimulation of nerves in the context of bioelectric medicine can be achieved with electric fields delivered by electroceuticals or neuroprostetic devices.  The design of neuroprostetic devices, as well as the definition of protocols for stimulation or inhibition of specific fibers in a specific patient, is a complex undertaking, complicated by the large inter-subject variability of nerve morphologies. The characteristics of nerves, e.g., internal structures and the number and composition of fascicles (fiber diameter, presence or absence of myelination, etc.) impact the therapeutic efficacy and efficiency of medical protocols based on neurostimulation devices.  Computational modelling of nerves and electroceuticals that combines electromagnetic (EM) and neuronal simulation with electrophysiological models of axons and nerves within high-resolution anatomical human models, permits intelligent design of devices and the individuation of the best stimulating parameters. Anatomically accurate models of nerves – derived from histology and medical imaging cross sections – that feature realistic morphology, fascicles, and axonal distribution are valuable tools for correct formulation of personalized stimulation settings.  The aim of this project is the development of a computational platform and a pipeline to automatically create computational realistic models of nerves, starting from images of nerve cross sections and statistical nerve properties. The pipeline includes automatic image segmentation, tissue identification, axonal counting, and morphology reconstruction in 3D, and the reconstructed anatomical models will be used to functionalize anatomical human computational models in which nerve trajectories have been identified. Depending on the interest and ability of the student the neuro-functionalized anatomical bodies will be used to perform neurostimulation investigations for design and optimization of electroceuticals, evaluate safety, and investigate mechanisms of action. Depending on the results, the resulting framework will be integrated in the commercial computational life sciences simulation platform Sim4Life.  The student should have good C++ or Python skills. The project will give the student the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with these exciting techniques.  The workplace will be at the IT’IS Foundation in Zurich. The workflow will include:  a literature search for theory and methods code development and optimization development of a series of nerve models for verification &amp; validation purposes. The extent of the project will be defined and finalized according to the interests and knowledge of the student. Please contact cassara@itis.swiss for more information and further details.

The postdocs will be joining a highly interdisciplinary research team and will be supervised by Dr. Catherine Jutzeler/Dr. Bastian Rieck and Prof. Karsten Borgwardt. The positions should start no later than February 15, 2020.  The Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) is one of ETH Zurich's youngest departments and the only one located in Basel outside of the Zurich campus. It unites biologists, engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians to work towards a quantitative understanding and purposeful engineering of complex biological systems.  Job description  The positions are funded by Dr. Catherine Jutzeler's and Dr. Bastian Rieck's recently awarded SNSF Spark Grants on Machine Learning for Alzheimer's Disease.  Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the sixth-leading cause of death for Americans ages 65 years and older. It is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and, eventually, an individual’s ability to perform even the simplest tasks, such as bathing, feeding, and dressing. Beyond the immediate health consequences, the societal costs are of epidemic proportion, thus making AD a pressing public health and medical problem. With disease-modifying treatment trials still unsuccessful at the present time and only medications to treat symptoms available, an emerging research initiative is to identify approaches to intervene before the damage begins, making it potentially possible to prevent AD.  The two positions will focus on either one of the following two promising approaches:  Analyzing changes in brain connectivity over time by developing novel techniques based on topological data analysis (TDA), a recent paradigm for multivariate data analysis, and integrating them into modern machine learning models. Developing a “surrogate human disease model” based on knowledge about traumatic brain injury, a central nervous disease with an acute onset whose pathologies closely resemble those of Alzheimer’s disease. Using techniques from the domain of transfer learning, knowledge about traumatic brain injuries should then be translated to Alzheimer’s disease. Your profile  Applicants should be highly motivated and creative, show an exceptional track record, and hold a doctoral degree in Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics, or related fields, and be interested in working in an interdisciplinary environment at the interface of Machine Learning and Personalized Medicine. Experience in developing algorithms for large-scale data analysis problems in biology and medicine is an asset. Academic excellence, a professional work attitude, and a proactive and self-driven work ethic are expected. The positions offer the opportunity to gain leadership and supervision experience in joint projects with younger scientists. Initially, the positions are fully funded for one year. They will be located in the Machine Learning and Computational Biology Laboratory at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering at the ETH Campus in Basel.  ETH Zurich ETH Zurich is one of the world’s leading universities specialising in science and technology.

The EPFL campus offers an exceptional working environment at the heart of a community of 16,000 people, including over 10,000 students and 3,500 researchers from 120 different countries. A postdoctoral position is available in the Schoonjans Lab at the Laboratory of Metabolic Signaling in the Institute of Bioengineering of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).  Postdoctoral position in metabolite sensing and adult stem cell homeostasis   Our laboratory is a dynamic multi-disciplinary research lab dedicated to developing technology and knowledge oriented at dissecting the multifaceted connections between the gut and the liver in the enterohepatic physiological system. By investigating the molecular basis by which nutrient-derived metabolites, including bile acids and other signaling molecules, act as controllers of tissue homeostasis, your mission will be part of a larger scope in the laboratory to identify novel mechanisms and strategies to target a wide range of chronic disorders, including metabolic diseases (obesity, diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and cancer.   The project focuses on the liver-gut axis, a system specialized in nutrient sensing and processing that plays a major role in the regulation of whole-body physiology. These two organs communicate extensively via the biliary tract, portal vein, and systemic mediators. Intestinal factors regulate bile acid synthesis, glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver whereas hepatic molecules, such as bile acids, influence intestinal homeostasis. The project covers both ways of this communication system with particular emphasis on metabolic regulation of adult epithelial stem cells. By investigating how nutrient-derived molecules trigger adaptive responses in the enterohepatic system, the project aims at dissecting the regulation of hepatic progenitor metabolism and function by the intestine and the gut microbiome. Conversely, we are interested in understanding how liver-produced bile acids can control intestinal renewal under normal and pathological conditions such as diet-induced obesity and cancer. The project is strongly oriented toward the design of stem cell-based regenerative medicine therapies as innovative approach for the treatment of different metabolic diseases. We will use state of the art in vivo approaches involving diet-induced and genetically modified animal models as well as mouse- and human-derived intestine and liver 3D organoid culture systems. These organoids will be used for genetic manipulation, imaging, co-cultures, and omics analysis in order to investigate fundamental questions related to the liver-gut axis and its regulation by signaling molecules. Moreover, intestine and liver organoids will be engineered to model metabolic dysfunctions, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and intestinal cancers, and used for high throughput drug screening.   We are looking for a highly motivated, successful and enthusiastic candidate with a PhD in biomedicine or related area. We expect the candidate to have a competitive scientific background and an excellent record of primary author publications. Previous experience working with mouse models and primary cultures as well as stem cell/tumor biology would be an advantage.

The successful candidate will work on demonstrating how interpretable artificial intelligence can lead to the generation of new biological insights in computational biology, a flourishing field, where the recent application of deep neural networks to long-standing problems such as the prediction of functional DNA sequences, the inference of protein–protein interactions or the detection of cancer cells in histopathology images has brought a breakthroughs in performance and prediction power. However, despite initial achievements, many of these models were built as black-boxes and have failed to provide new biological insights. A major focus of the work will be to develop new methods that can shed light on the underlying biological principles driving model decisions.  A major application area will be the analysis of single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) data from tumor samples. CyTOF technology is achieving tremendously high throughput regarding the number of profiled cells, with some of the most recent datasets consisting of millions of single cells (see, for instance, recent work by our group. The successful candidate will develop new state-of-the-art deep learning networks to model CyTOF data and novel interpretable approaches to extract insight from the models. Several directions will be explored, some of them relying on the generation of disentangled representations that clearly and disjointly map latent and data generative factors; the exploration of architecture-constraint models, which can enhance the interpretability of certain components of the network; or the investigation of parallels with Lagrangian mechanics in physics to identify network invariances that can highlight underlying mechanisms.    The successful candidate will work in a highly interdisciplinary team and be supported by the rich AI community assembled at IBM Research – Zurich. Candidates should have a strong background in Computer Science, Mathematics or Physics and be interested in cancer-related research. Strong programming skills are necessary. Experience in mathematical modelling, statistics, probability and machine learning and/or deep learning are necessary. Candidates with a Mathematics or Physics background are especially encouraged to apply.  About the group  The Systems Biology group at IBM aims to develop new mathematical and computational approaches to analyze and exploit the latest generation of biomedical data. In the context of cancer, the group focuses on developing computational and statistical approaches to unravel cancer molecular mechanisms using high-throughput multi-omics datasets and single-cell molecular data. A major interest is the development of artificial intelligence approaches for personalized medicine and drug modelling, activities that have been supported by two H2020 consortia: PrECISE (2015–2018) and iPC (2019–2022).  Recently, the group has become interested in the field of interpretable artificial intelligence. Although this line of research is relatively young, the group has some preliminary methods that will be presented at NeurIPS 2019 ( MonoNet ). A particular approach for interpretability, attention mechanisms, has also been used to improve the performance and transparency of drug models ( PaccMann ). Also, in the summer of 2019, the group organized two workshops on “Interpretability for deep learning in computational biology” at ISMB and BC2 conferences, both of which attracted significant attention within the computational biology community.
