January 2020 The Swiss Nanoscience Institute (SNI) at the University of Basel invites highly motivated scientists to apply for the SNI PhD program in Nanoscience. Your position Current in-vitro cardiac tissue-models lack a temporal electrocoupling of the cardiomyocytes through a network of highly conductive fibers. This so-called syncytium, consisting of Purkinjie fibers, is however the fundamental tissue property enabling the typical contraction pattern of the myocardium. In particular, those fibers are specialized cells with a high conductivity function capable to propagate timely the electrical signal throughout the whole myocardium (Ideker RE, et al., Purkinje Fibers and Arrhythmias, Pacing Clin Electrophysiol. 2009). In contrast to in-vivo cultures, the neonatal or fetal phenotype cells used for in-vitro cultures are not capable to fully mature and form branched cardiomyocytes with a syncytium. Therefore, an artificial syncytium needs to be implemented in cardiac tissue models. This multidisciplinary PhD project in nano science with a focus on cardiac tissue bioengineering aims to mimic the Purkinjie fibers by implementing an electrically conductive and organized nanotube network into the engineered myocardial tissue in order to (1) promote the electrical coupling among neighboring cardiomyocytes, (2) form a functional syncytium and (3) potentially stimulate the maturation towards a branched myocardial tissue. Your tasks • development and 3D bioprinting of cell laden hydrogels for cardiac tissue engineering • hydrogel functionalization with nanotubes • use of electromagnetic fields to orient the nanotubes in 3D • nanofabrication and nanoimaging • cell culture and tissue engineering • bioreactor technology development and implementation for physical conditioning (electrical, mechanical) of bioengineered cardiac tissues; • 3D morphometric analysis and functional assessment of cardiac tissue contractility; • histological, biochemical, molecular assays. Your profile We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic PhD student interested in working on the generation of engineered patches for cardiac tissue repair. MSc in engineering, physics or biotechnology is preferred.
