We are a newly established laboratory at the Institute for Electronics, pursuing use-inspired chemical engineering and materials science projects to improve existing technologies and to enable new functionalities. We focus on nanomaterials, such as semiconductor and metallic nanoparticles, and inorganic molecular precursors as building blocks for efficient devices, engineered via bottom-up liquid-phase fabrication approaches.  Project background Phase-change memory (PCM) is a new non-volatile memory technology on market, which is faster, more durable, and unique with respect to traditional silicon-based devices. However, there are open challenges for PCM technology, such as large power consumption and high price of PCM devices, which stem from large dimensions of memory cells and from the use of material-inefficient sputtering and etching fabrication steps for the expensive PCM layer. We address these open challenges by developing liquid-phase synthetic approaches for the PCM nanoparticles and ink formulations. With the possibility to provide a size control and composition diversity for colloidal PCM nanoparticles, we will bring new insights on size-dependent phase transitions and high-temperature structural dynamics, enable new device configurations and energy-efficient fabrication and operation of PCM arrays.  Job description This PhD thesis will be focused on liquid-phase synthesis and structural characterization of colloidal nanoparticles, relevant to the PCM technology. The PhD student will learn synthetic chemistry of nanoparticles, will use high-end characterization techniques, and will participate in several synchrotron beamtimes. This project is funded by European Research Council (ERC). The access to chemistry laboratories and characterization tools is secured.  Your profile The successful candidate must have a Master degree in chemistry or materials science and an excellent background in related fields.

In a collaboration with SECO and SUVA within the national inspections campaign of chemicals at work, the research project aims at improving the assessment of occupational exposure to hazardous volatile chemicals in complex mixtures used in industrial and professional sectors.  Project background Many chemical products used at workplaces, such as paints, lacquers or lubricants contain hazardous volatile components, which upon inhalation may lead to associated health risks. In general, exposure levels to vapors depend on the specific use of the chemical product (e.g. temperature, type of application), and the physicochemical properties of the components (e.g. solubility, miscibility, and volatility). For instance, when the operating temperature leads to evaporation of some less hazardous components, the concentration of the remaining more hazardous ones is increased, which in turn may increase their volatility and lead to increased inhalation hazards. Or, when a product is reactive, the mixture composition changes with time, which influences the activity coefficients of all components. Therefore, to examine inhalation risks the type of application and the interactions of the components with each other need to be considered.  Job description   Categorizing complex chemical products used in different industrial or professional sectors in terms of composition, use and properties of the components. Estimating workers’ exposure to hazardous components depending on the form of the chemical product (liquid mixtures, powders, suspensions, or emulsions) and its use (industrial spraying, mixing processes, or open bath systems). Extending exposure models to include the effect of non-ideal mixing by including activity coefficients obtained from a thermodynamic model. The start of the project is as soon as possible.

We combine peptide, inorganic and medicinal chemistry as well as molecular biology to solve current healthcare challenges of metal poisoning by applying a broad range of techniques and skill-sets. Please find further information on our group's website. Your responsibilities  Lead (Pb) is lethal to almost every organism, ranging from bacteria to humans. All are exposed to the toxic metal due to various environmental contaminations including the use of Pb-containing bullets for hunting. This exposure is normally tragically deadly to various scavengers such as eagles and condors, but revealed a potential resistance to Pb in common ravens. Despite the fact that ravens consume the same contaminated flesh as the other scavengers, they show no Pb poisoning symptoms. This specific natural resistance provides an unusual opportunity for discovery. The goal of this project is to identify the mechanism by which ravens can survive elevated consumption of Pb. Our ground hypothesis is that a natural chelator in the body fluids of ravens enables the detoxification of the Pb ions and gives rise to the species' resistance.

Your position Square-planar Pt(II) complexes have a strong tendency to aggregate and to form stacks with short metal-metal contacts between individual complexes. This can lead to extended onedimensional structures exhibiting high electric conductance, vapochromism, and photoluminescence. Until recently, most compounds of this type were made from achiral building blocks, but recent research suggests that nanowires from chiral Pt(II) complexes give access to helical superstructures with unusual properties. In this proposed project, we plan to combine the expertise of the Sparr group in the area of axially chiral organic molecules with the knowledge of the Wenger group in coordination chemistry and spectroscopy to explore a conceptually new class of nanowires featuring Pt(II) based chiral superstructures. Their sensing properties for volatile organic compounds (VOC) and chiral recognition of atmospheric terpenes relevant to global warming will be of key interest.

January 2020 The Swiss Nanoscience Institute (SNI) at the University of Basel invites highly motivated scientists to apply for the SNI PhD program in Nanoscience. Your position In situ characterization methods are of high importance to elucidate the complex physical processes occurring inside fuel cells. In particular, the distribution of temperature across the different layers of the cell plays an important role in water management and in durability. To date, only invasive techniques (e.g. insertion of thermocouples whose dimensions are similar to the layer thickness) have been reported for this measurement. In this project, we will explore the use of magnetic nanoparticles as mediators for the temperature measurement. A polarized neutron beam such as the one provided at the BOA beam line of the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) will be depolarized by ferromagnetic nanoparticles due to the randomly oriented magnetic field they produce. When heated above their Curie temperature, these particles will become paramagnetic and the beam will stay polarized. Using a spin analyser and an imaging detector, we will therefore obtain an image of the temperature distribution in a non-invasive way, thanks to the ability of neutron to penetrate a large variety of materials used in fuel cell design. The scope of this PhD thesis will include the synthesis of nano-particles, the ex-situ characterization of their physical and magnetic properties, their inclusion into fuel cell materials and the characterization of their suitability for the temperature measurement using a polarized neutron beam. Additionally, the inclusion of material into real operating fuel cells will be conducted in collaboration with other students and researchers. This PhD thesis will be conducted as a collaboration between the Laboratory for Neutron Scattering and Imaging (LNS, PSI) and the Electrochemistry Laboratory (LEC, PSI).

January 2020 The Swiss Nanoscience Institute (SNI) at the University of Basel invites highly motivated scientists to apply for the SNI PhD program in Nanoscience. Your position Catalysis in hydrogen bond-based supramolecular capsules is the main research direction in the Tiefenbacher group. Much like enzymes, such capsules feature a nanometer-sized cavity where suitable reactions can be accelerated due to noncovalent interactions between the substrate and host. Interesting results concerning complex terpene cyclizations, which were inaccessible with man made catalysts before, have been obtained in our laboratory (for more information see: https://nanocat.chemie.unibas.ch/en/research/). Although these examples clearly demonstrated the potential of this approach, selectivity issues remain. Due to the high symmetry of the nanometer sized reaction compartment on the inside of the molecular capsule, the conformation of the flexible acyclic terpene substrates cannot be controlled well. The floppy binding translates into a poor selectivity during terpene cyclizations. To achieve selective cyclizations for biologically relevant sesqui- and diterpenes, less symmetric cavities, able to constrain the conformationally freedom of the encapsulated the substrate, are required. The overall aim of this project is the discovery of novel heteromeric self-assembled molecular capsules suitable for selective sesqui- and diterpene cyclizations. Since there is no rational approach available, we aim for a broad screening approach aided by machine learning algorithms developed in the von Lilienfeld lab (for more information see: https://chemspacelab.org/ ).

January 2020 The Swiss Nanoscience Institute (SNI) at the University of Basel invites highly motivated scientists to apply for the SNI PhD program in Nanoscience. Your position Stereotypic spatiotemporal spreading of pathological lesions through the nervous system is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. The prion-like spreading model provides an elegant explanation for this observation [1], postulating that misfolded proteins (amyloids) can disease healthy cells by imprinting their misfold onto endogenous proteins. However, the precise spreading mechanism and information carrier is still unknown. Huntington's disease (HD) is an archetypical example of the prion-like spreading phenomena: dominantly inherited mutations lead to the misfolding and aggregation of the huntingtin (HTT) protein and the onset of the lethal disease in a patient's age of around 35 years. HD is manifested by uncontrolled movements, depression, and a loss of cognition. The project is based on our recently developed platform for microfluidics-based sample preparation for electron microscopy (EM) called 'cryoWriter' [2,3] which allows novel strategies for single-cell analysis by 'differential visual proteomics' [4] and 'interaction-labeling' [5]. Furthermore, we developed a microfluidic platform for the co-culture of diseased and healthy cells, assuring exclusive communication via neurites. A primary task will be to further develop the cryoWriter system for the integration of the cell-culturing chip to allow direct investigation of the neurite interaction region between two cells by electron tomography. The specific aims of the project are (I) to study the transmission pathway of the misfolded mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) from diseased to healthy cells, (ii) to study the fate and effects of these amyloid nanoparticles in the cell using our recently developed 'visual proteomics' approaches, and (iii) to develop a new microfluidics platform that allows precise studying of the synaptic interaction between neurons by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) tomography at nanometer-scale precision.

January 2020 The Swiss Nanoscience Institute (SNI) at the University of Basel invites highly motivated scientists to apply for the SNI PhD program in Nanoscience. Your position Current in-vitro cardiac tissue-models lack a temporal electrocoupling of the cardiomyocytes through a network of highly conductive fibers. This so-called syncytium, consisting of Purkinjie fibers, is however the fundamental tissue property enabling the typical contraction pattern of the myocardium. In particular, those fibers are specialized cells with a high conductivity function capable to propagate timely the electrical signal throughout the whole myocardium (Ideker RE, et al., Purkinje Fibers and Arrhythmias, Pacing Clin Electrophysiol. 2009). In contrast to in-vivo cultures, the neonatal or fetal phenotype cells used for in-vitro cultures are not capable to fully mature and form branched cardiomyocytes with a syncytium. Therefore, an artificial syncytium needs to be implemented in cardiac tissue models. This multidisciplinary PhD project in nano science with a focus on cardiac tissue bioengineering aims to mimic the Purkinjie fibers by implementing an electrically conductive and organized nanotube network into the engineered myocardial tissue in order to (1) promote the electrical coupling among neighboring cardiomyocytes, (2) form a functional syncytium and (3) potentially stimulate the maturation towards a branched myocardial tissue.

The project includes a study of modern and ancient evaporites via experiments, fieldwork, and laboratory analyses of natural samples. It is aimed at developing new archives for seawater isotope composition of Mg and stable-Sr and at using these archives to reconstruct past variations in these isotope compositions of the ocean.  Project background In recent years, the oceanic balance of Mg and stable-Sr isotopes (as δ26Mg and δ88/86Sr values) has been investigated, demonstrating their potential to trace past variations in the oceanic inputs and outputs of these elements. However, the scarcity of past seawater δ26Mg and δ88/86Sr record data, and differences between existing data-sets (all based on Ca-carbonate archives), currently limit this approach. In this project, we will explore and develop new evaporitic (non-Ca-carbonate) archives for seawater δ26Mg and δ88/86Sr values and use them to reconstruct past variations in seawater composition. In that framework, we will also study the environmental conditions related to the formation of these evaporitic sequences as well as their post-depositional preservation.  Job description The position is funded for four years by the Swiss National Science Foundation. It includes mainly geochemistry laboratory work as well as two field trips for sampling (in Italy and Israel), sedimentary and petrological study of the sequences, data analysis and modeling and outcomes communication (in conferences and papers).

Our mission is to deliver the scientific basis for the development of innovative technologies to mitigate corrosion.  We invite applications for a PhD position. The student will work under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Ueli Angst and Dr. Zhidong Zhang. Likely starting date: January 2020.  Project background Corrosion of infrastructures, such as bridges and pipelines, causes high costs to society and impairs the safety and the quality of life. This project forms part of a larger research framework, aiming at innovative corrosion mitigation strategies, based on electrochemical methods. We combine methods from corrosion science, environmental sciences, and reactive transport modeling. In particular, we seek to address the challenge of corrosion of steel-based infrastructures surrounded by porous media, such as reinforcing steel in concrete and steel in soil.  Job description The aim of this PhD project is to develop a comprehensive numerical model framework that takes into account all relevant processes occurring at the steel surface and in the porous medium when a metal is subjected to electrochemical polarization. The main novelty lies in developing the scientific theory to consider the electrochemical reaction kinetics at the protected metal as a function of the electrolyte chemistry, and to couple this with state-of-the-art reactive multi-species transport modeling in porous media. We will focus on steel corrosion in (sandy) soils and in cementitious materials (mortar, concrete). To obtain the needed input data and to validate the model, this project will be closely linked to an on-going experimental PhD study in the research group, which takes advantage of latest developments in in-situ sensing techniques (pH, O2, Cl–) and microstructural characterization.  The conditions of employment are based on the Swiss Federal Personnel Act and the ETH Personnel Ordinance. The salary rates of PhD students are in agreement with the employment conditions of ETH (covering living expenses).  Your profile Successful applicants should hold a MSc degree preferably in engineering, physics, mathematics, geophysics or related areas with a strong background in numerical modeling. Ideally, the candidate is already experienced with reactive transport modeling in porous media. Knowledge in corrosion is not required, but the candidate is expected to show a strong interest in this field and to study the theory.

Project background Chemical reactions between "supercritical" water and minerals are a key process in many geochemical processes such as ore deposit formation, mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems, continental geothermal systems and others. However, we are currently unable to quantitatively understand these as there exists no formalism to describe the chemical behavior of dissolved components in "supercritical" water under the condistions of interest (temperature higher than 374°C and pressures of 10s of MPa). This strongly limits our ability to predict how chemical fluid-rock interaction will affect the future use of the upcoming technology of utilizing "supercritical" geothermal resoruces but is also a fundamental limitation for applications in the fields of ore deposits, marine hydrothermal systems, chemical engineering etc.  Job description We are seeking a highly motivated candidate (f/m) with a strong interest in quantitative modelling of mineral-fluid equilibria and with an MSc degree in geochemistry, chemical engineering, physical chemistry or a related discipline. As the key work to be performed, the candidate is expected to develop a passion for collecting and critically assessing data sets from the literature and complementary experimental and simulation work performed by other groups of the project, to identify systematic trends and to cast them into coherent equations. Depending on the candidate\'s background the exact direction of this approach may be more geoscience- or more physical chemistry-oriented.  Your profile We expect self-driven and motivated interaction with the partner groups in Iceland, France, Germany, Norway, and Great Britain. If successful, your work will likely lead to some fundamental publications that form the basis for future broad applications across a wide range of disciplines.  The position is primarily targeted as a PhD study but in case of an exceptionally qualified candidate we may consider hiring on a junior postdoc level.
