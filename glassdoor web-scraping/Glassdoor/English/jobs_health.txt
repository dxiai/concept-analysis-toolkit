Concerningly, Legionnaire’s disease incidence is rising, with a 35% increase in the number of cases in Switzerland between 2016-2018. Legionnaire’s disease is caused by inhalation of aerosolized Legionella spp., for example via showering and/or cooling towers for buildings with Legionella spp. colonizing the plumbing. Dealing with Legionella in building plumbing is a multi-disciplinary challenge ranging from basic to applied research and involving stakeholders from academia, industry and government.  Within this context, Eawag is leading a multisite collaboration with the Swiss Federal Government (BLV), the technical university of Lucerne (HSLU), the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss-TPH) and the cantonal laboratory of Zurich (KLZH), with further support from a global network of experts on Legionella spp., building plumbing, and health effects. The project is focused on informing management strategies to address contributions of the built environment to the increasing incidence of Legionnaire’s disease. Specific foci of the project include: 1) improving methods for Legionella spp. detection and control in plumbing systems, 2) investigating both operational and ecological strategies for Legionella spp. control, and 3) assessing risk-based water quality guidelines targeting Legionella spp. and potential impacts on Legionnaire’s disease.  If you are excited about this topic, and you hold an M.Sc. in biology, environmental sciences, environmental engineering, public health, or related field, you are invited to apply. Prior experience in a microbiology laboratory is a strong asset. Fluency in German, French or Italian is an asset but not required. The candidate must be eager to execute one or more of several techniques including (but not limited to) molecular and microbiological laboratory work, environmental sampling, epidemiology, risk assessment, and modeling. The candidate must be willing to work in a team environment. We offer a very dynamic and collaborative research environment which profits from state-of-the-art infrastructure and support. In addition, the PhD student(s) will interact with aforementioned collaborators, including leading international researchers in the field.

Name Studio API (http://namestudioapi.com) is an API-as-a-service recommender system for domain names. The system applies advanced language models and utilizes multiple data sources including trending topics, popular keywords, geography, semantic relevance, and others. This is done across 10 languages (English, French, German, Spanish etc) and thousands of TLDs (.com, .net, .tv, .info, .ch, .fr, .de etc).  The system has a light front-end (React) demonstrating the functionality and a back-end (Java, Spring, Tensorflow) generating domain suggestions, where most of the development work is done. The key challenges we face when building the product are obtaining high quality, relevant, and meaningful suggestions while offering very low response times on a global scale, serving high request volumes.    The team possesses extensive technical ownership over the product. The work style of the team is closer to an internal startup where all the team members are involved in the majority of product development phases and are flexible moving from one focus area to another. In terms of the process, we rely on Scrum with tickets prioritized in Jira. Our code is located on internal GitHub; we follow Git Flow with pull request code reviews.  For continuous delivery we use Jenkins with pipelines and our product deployments are automated with Ansible and Terraform. The product can be rolled out from zero to the operating state in a single button click. We do builds for each codebase change as well as nightly builds. We have automated testing with substantial coverage. When we need to process large amounts of data, we use Hadoop and Spark, which are available on internal clusters. TensorFlow and Keras enable us to go quickly from research prototypes trained on our GPUs to production-ready systems. It is clearly beneficial if the candidate has experience working with some of the mentioned tools.    As part of this advanced software development team, the new member will participate in all phases of software development including requirements analysis, design, testing &amp; performance, scalability, documentation and support.

The team member will also help in improving the system back-end as well-as build and deployment processes, and in supporting the service in production environments across multiple locations.

The brainstem plays an essential role in controlling the generation of diverse body actions. Yet, surprisingly little is known about how functionally diverse neurons collaborate to select and execute appropriate actions. Our recent work has revealed the existence of highly organized circuits in the brainstem, with functionally dedicated neuronal populations acting as command lines to generate diverse actions including skilled forelimb movement and locomotion (Esposito et al., 2014, Nature; Capelli et al., 2017, Nature; Pivetta et al., 2014 Cell; Basaldella et al., 2015 Cell). The goal of our future work is to understand the functionality of these identified brainstem neurons within the broader context of the motor system, to reveal the circuit level mechanisms by which one action is selected over another, and to understand how neuronal activity can drive programs to generate the diverse but specific actions of our bodies needed to carry out all behaviors. For additional information on our laboratory’s work, see: www.fmi.ch/arber.s.  The successful candidate should be highly motivated to contribute to our efforts to understand the function of the motor system. He/she should have a background in applying in vivo methods to neuronal circuit function and is expected to take a leading role in in vivo electrophysiology and/or 2-photon imaging experiments (data acquisition and analysis), aligned with recording behavior.
